reunite families.

KEY FEATURES:
• Trilingual support (English, Sinhala, Tamil)
• Search missing persons by district
• Report sightings of missing persons

This is the ONLY platform with full Tamil language support, critical for reaching 
Tamil-speaking communities in Northern and Eastern provinces.

We are a volunteer-driven initiative with no commercial interests. Our only goal
